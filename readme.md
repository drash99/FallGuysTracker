## Done:
* Find out who is playing this round (their nicknames, their platforms, their team and their current score)
* Find out current team rank (all the teams' score and finished players)
* Find out my score, my rank on the round and my finishing time.
* Find out my teammates' score.
* See my score, my rank, my teammates' score and my team's rank on the overlay window.

## Todos:
* Fancy GUI
* Team score for survival round

## Misc
* Measuring the time cannot be done accurately because log file format has changed.
